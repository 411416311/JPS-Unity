# JPS-Unity (WIP)
Interactive JPS Search Algorithim, using Steve Rabin's NEW JPS w/ Goal Bounding algorithm.
Steve Rabins code is located here: https://github.com/SteveRabin/JPSPlusWithGoalBounding

## Overview
This program is designed is to help others understand the JPS Plus with Goal Bounding Search algorithm by breaking it up into a step by step process.

* First, the user is allowed to create a custom sized grid, placing obstacles and walls anywhere he/she pleases.  
* After the grid is created, the user can be begin the precomputation process.  This process will calculate jump points, jump point distances, and goal bounds.  
* Once all precomputations are done, the user will be able to select a start and target position on the grid and then watch how the algorithm jumps through the map, finding the optimal path.
